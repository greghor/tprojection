This library allows you to visually inspect the relation between a dependent variable (the
target) and a predictor in a meaningful way. This library is particularly convenient when the
target and/or the predictor are categorical, ie when it is difficult to compute a traditionnal correlation coefficient.
And by the way, Tprojection stands for target projection.

Installation
------------

.. code-block::

   pip install tprojection


Basic usage
-----------

.. code-block::

    from tprojection import Tprojection

    tproj = Tprojection(df, "target", "predictor")
    tproj.plot()


Advanced usage
--------------

You can find several examples depicting more advanced functionalities in ``examples/examples.ipynb``
